# Football BettingSite : ThousandsxBets (Uni Project)

A front-end web project simulating a football betting platform. This project mainly focuses on **Gemini AI API integration** 
to power a smart FAQ chatbot. The site includes various pages such as Home, Region, Signup, Football Odds, Popular Teams, and FAQ.

## Key Feature: Gemini AI Integration in FAQ Page

The FAQ section is integrated with **Google's Gemini AI API**, enabling the site to respond to user questions dynamically. We trained the model with potential user questions and corresponding answers, making the chatbot more relevant to the domain.

> Q&A logic — the AI understands and responds based on trained examples.
